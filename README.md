# Advanced Data Analysis Techniques

## Project Overview
This project, titled "Advanced Data Analysis Techniques," is designed to explore and apply various advanced methodologies in data analysis. The project is documented in an R Markdown file (`Advanced_Data_Analysis_Techniques.Rmd`) and covers techniques such as data wrangling, visualization, and statistical modeling.

## Data Source
The dataset(s) used in this project are sourced from publicly available data repositories. The specific dataset(s) and their sources are referenced within the R Markdown file.

- **Primary Data Source**: 
  - [Chicago Data Portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/)
  - [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following files and directories:

- `Advanced_Data_Analysis_Techniques.Rmd`: R Markdown file containing the code and narrative for the analysis.
- `data/`: Directory where datasets are stored (if included).
- `output/`: Folder for any visualizations or reports generated by the R Markdown file.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview and instructions.

## Summary
The project demonstrates advanced data analysis techniques using R, including data cleaning, transformation, exploratory data analysis, and visualization. The final outputs include visualizations and statistical summaries that provide insights into the data.

## Installation and Usage
To run this project, ensure that you have R and RStudio installed on your machine. The following R packages are required:

- `tidyverse`
- `ggplot2`
- `dplyr`
- `readr`
- `knitr`

### Steps to Run:
1. Open the `.Rmd` file in RStudio.
2. Run the code chunks sequentially to reproduce the analysis.
3. Use the "Knit" function to generate the final report in HTML, PDF, or Word format.
